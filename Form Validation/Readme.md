Form Validation

**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
whenever we login into any web page then there in the login form they set up the auto validation functionality with the help of javascript.  This means each part of the form has restricted if is an email section then there should be a valid email otherwise it wouldn't accept.


### How does it work
While loading there will be a registration form for you just need to enter the data as per the required field and at the end hit the submit button. So, from here javascript will validate each filed value if there will be any match it would accept and it will throw an error.

**Stack**:  
And in order to tick the check box just put x inside them for example - [x] like this. Please delete options that are not relevant.

- [x] Html
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript
