This is a project built using Frontend Technologies.I've tried to implement CSS animation to at its
most. It is fully responsive

Notice:
open the app in only fixed viewport then don't try to change it as it would affect the animation.
if you want to check its resposiveness in mobile then decrease the size of viewport and then 
refresh the page.
