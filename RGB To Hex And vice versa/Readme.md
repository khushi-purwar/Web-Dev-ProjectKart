RGB TO HEX Converter.

**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
We all know this is one of the most ingredients of our web development journey, That is nothing but our color and we already know that we have to assign color values in two different types. That is hex-color and RGB color formate.

### How does it work
In this project, just this is the conversion between them hex color to RGB color. Although we can use any of them while working on a project but just for fun playing I have designed this project.
