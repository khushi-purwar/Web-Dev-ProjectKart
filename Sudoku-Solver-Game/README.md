# Sudoku Solver Game

## About The Project

It is a digital version of the familiar sudoku game that we have been played since childhood days.

The player can select any cell and enter the desired number. The player wins the game if the puzzle is solved.
There is also a timer to keep track of the time lapsed since playing.
