<h1 align="center">ADVANCED SUDOKU GAME WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS</h3>

  

 


### About The Project
In this project, I'll create A high-end Sudoku Game, starting with an option to choose the level of difficulty and allowing a user to solve that to earn points. You have to input numbers from 1 to 9 in order to complete the puzzle box. The size of the puzzle varies from small to large and there are 3 levels to this game.
