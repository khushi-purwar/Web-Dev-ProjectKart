**Project title**
Detect key and keycode

**Project Description**
### The idea behind this project
Just based on the random thinking that whenever we click on any key from the keyboard how does it actually print the same letter although it lots of theory on mechanism so I'm just concentrated on the functional part.
 

### How does it work
While loading there will be a registration form for you just need to enter the data as per the required field and at the end hit the submit button. So, from here javascript will validate each filed value if there will be any match it would accept and it will throw an error.

**Stack**:  
And in order to tick the check box just put x inside them for example - [x] like this. Please delete options that are not relevant.

- [x] Html
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript
