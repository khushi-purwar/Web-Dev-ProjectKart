                Education helps us get exposure to new ideas and concepts that we can use to appreciate and improve the
                world around us and the world within us.

                The world around us is everything external. The world within us is everything internal; like our mind,
                our body, and our emotions.

                Education is the tool that breaks down all barriers. Education is part of the foundation of all progress
                and growth, both as an individual and as a society.

                All things are possible because anything can be learned.
                Sometimes you just need something really smart to say to inspire and motivate yourself and those around
                you. And, if you are like me, those times don’t come around every moment of the day.

                Luckily there are people who have had flashes of brilliance throughout history when talking about the
                concept of education, teaching, and learning and someone even smarter wrote it down.
