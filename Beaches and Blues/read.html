    <h1>AIM</h1>
    <p>This website is made to raise awareness among people regarding the cleanliness
        of environment particularly beaches. Litter around oceans and seas is not only affecting 
        human life but also devastates the aquatic life, both flaura and fauna.
        Through this small initative we expect people to come forward and help us in 
        saving the environment in whatever way they can.
        This website keeps tracks of your activites Through the media you upload in form of 
        pictures, videos and snippets. </p>
        
          <h1>SERVICES</h1>
          <p>The modus operand of this website is to help our customers while they help
              us cleaning the environment. They earn some points each time they make a post on 
              their respective accounts.
              These points are later translated into rewards. These rewards are either vocuhers 
              which they can use while shopping on online platforms or these can also be translated as
              discount coupons on their tarrif during their next stay. These can also be used to make 
              donations to differnet NGO's and organisations.
              <br>
              We intend to go hand in hand with differnet online platforms, hotels, motels and NGO's 
              so that our users get the maximum benefit out of it.
              Through this process we also create jobs for different sectors of the society.
